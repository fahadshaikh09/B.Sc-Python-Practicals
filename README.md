## This Repository Contains Following Codes

*1. Program for Following Probelem Statments*

	a. Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will turn 100 years old.
	
	b. Enter the number from the user and depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.
	
	c. Write a program to generate the Fibonacci series.

	d. Write a function that reverses the user defined value.

	e. Write a function to check the input value is Armstrong and also write the function for Palindrome.

	f. Write a recursive function to print the factorial for a given number.

*2. Program for Following Probelem Statments*
	
	a. Write a function that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns True if it is a vowel, False otherwise.

	b. Define a function that computes the length of a given list or string. 

	c. Define a procedurehistogram() that takes a list of integers and prints a histogram to the screen. For example, histogram([4, 9, 7]) should print the following:
		****

		*********

		*******

*3. Program for Following Probelem Statments*

	a. A pangram is a sentence that contains all the letters of the English alphabet at least once, for example: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. Your task here is to write a function to check a sentence to see if it is a pangram or not.

	b. Take a list, say for example this one:
		a=[1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89]
		and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

*4. Program for Following Probelem Statments*
	
	a. Write a program that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common member.

	b. Write a Python program to print a specified list after removing the 0th, 2nd, 4th and 5th elements.

	c. Write a Python program to clone or copy a list
